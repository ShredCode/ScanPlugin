# ScanPlugin
Eclipse plugin to scan for unused annotated variables  

## Description
This plugin is for scanning for annotations like `AUTOWIRED` and `MOCK` that eclipse seems to go back and forth 
about if they mark them as being reported as declared and not used fields.

This plugin also allows users to update their preferences for the plugin to provide a user-entered list of comma seperated annotaions to scan for as well.

Users will be able to see the Problem as an: `Unused Problem`
